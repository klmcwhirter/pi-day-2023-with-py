## Credit where credit is due ...
The inspiration for this project was taken partially from Vi Hart - [Pi Day 3/14 1:59AM - Spring Ahead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHrth9lOfzo&ab_channel=Vihart).

I was especislly intrigued by her usage of segments of the digits of PI as repeating, arpeggiatic phrases of the piece.
